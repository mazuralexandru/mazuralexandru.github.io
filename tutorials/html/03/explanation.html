  <h1>03. Introduction: What is HTML? (Part 3: History &amp; Standards)</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s briefly touch upon the history of HTML and the importance of standards.</p>
<p><strong>A Brief History:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Origins:</strong> HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s while working at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research). His goal was to create a system for scientists to easily share documents and link between them.</li>
<li><strong>Evolution:</strong> HTML has gone through several versions:<ul>
<li>HTML (1), HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01</li>
<li>XHTML 1.0 / 1.1 (a stricter, XML-based version of HTML)</li>
<li><strong>HTML5:</strong> The current major version, which introduced many new features for modern web applications (multimedia, graphics, semantic structure, offline capabilities). HTML is now considered a &quot;Living Standard,&quot; meaning it evolves continuously rather than through large, discrete version releases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why the Evolution?</strong> To add new capabilities needed for richer web experiences, improve consistency, enhance accessibility, and adapt to new devices.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Standards Bodies:</strong></p>
<p>Who decides what goes into HTML? Two main organizations collaborate on its development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>W3C (World Wide Web Consortium):</strong> An international community that develops open standards to ensure the long-term growth of the Web. Historically the primary body for HTML specifications.</li>
<li><strong>WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group):</strong> A group of browser vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, Microsoft) and other stakeholders focused on the practical evolution of HTML and related technologies. WHATWG now maintains the core HTML Living Standard.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why Standards Matter:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine if every web browser interpreted HTML slightly differently! Websites would look broken or behave unexpectedly depending on the browser used. Standards ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Web pages look and function similarly across different browsers and devices.</li>
<li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Developers know what to expect when they write HTML code.</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> Different web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) work together smoothly.</li>
<li><strong>Future-Proofing:</strong> Adhering to standards helps ensure websites remain functional as browsers evolve.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <strong>Observation:</strong> Files are still empty. We&#39;re building context. Soon, we&#39;ll see how these standards translate into the actual code structure.</p>
<p>✨ <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Using standard HTML helps ensure your web pages work correctly for everyone, everywhere, now and in the future.</p>
