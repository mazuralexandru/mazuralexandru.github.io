  <h1>655. Validation: What is HTML Validation? - Core Definition</h1>
<p>Let&#39;s start by defining what we mean by &quot;HTML Validation&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>1.1. Formal Definition:</strong></p>
<p>HTML Validation is the process of checking your HTML markup against the specific rules, syntax, and constraints defined by the official HTML specification your document declares (usually via the <code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration, pointing to the HTML Living Standard or a specific earlier version). These specifications are maintained by standards bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>
<p><strong>1.2. Core Concept:</strong></p>
<p>Essentially, validation ensures your HTML code adheres to the official &quot;grammar&quot; and &quot;vocabulary&quot; of the HTML language. It verifies that you&#39;ve used elements and attributes correctly, nested them properly, and followed all the syntax rules laid out in the standard.</p>
<p><strong>1.3. Analogy:</strong></p>
<p>Think of it like running a sophisticated spell check and grammar check on a text document. A validator doesn&#39;t judge the <em>quality</em> of your content, but it checks if your HTML &quot;sentences&quot; (elements and attributes) are constructed according to the established rules of the HTML language. It&#39;s like proofreading your code against the official HTML rulebook.</p>
<p><strong>1.4. Well-formed vs. Valid HTML:</strong></p>
<p>It&#39;s useful to distinguish between:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Well-formed HTML:</strong> This generally means the code follows basic syntax rules like proper tag opening/closing and nesting (similar to well-formed XML). Modern browsers are very good at correcting minor well-formedness errors and <em>might</em> still render the page somewhat correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Valid HTML:</strong> This means the code conforms to <em>all</em> the rules of the specific HTML standard declared by the DOCTYPE. This includes using correct elements in the correct places, using only allowed attributes with valid values, ensuring required attributes are present (<code class="language-html">alt</code> on <code class="language-html">&lt;img&gt;</code>), ensuring <code>id</code> uniqueness, etc. <strong>Validity is the goal.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.5. Role of DOCTYPE (<code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>As we learned in Module 1, the DOCTYPE declaration at the very beginning of your HTML file is crucial. For validation, it tells the validator tool <strong>which set of rules</strong> (which version of the HTML standard) to check your code against.</li>
<li>For modern web development, <code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> signals the use of the current HTML Living Standard (often referred to loosely as HTML5). Older, more complex DOCTYPEs pointed to specific versions like HTML 4.01 Strict or XHTML 1.0, each with slightly different validation rulesets.</li>
</ul>
<p>✅ <strong>Observation:</strong> No code changes in this step. Focus on understanding that validation is a formal check against the official HTML standard rules defined by the W3C/WHATWG, going beyond just basic syntax correctness. Recognize the role of the DOCTYPE in setting the validation context.</p>
<p>✨ <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> HTML validation is the process of checking markup against the official HTML specification to ensure code correctness according to defined syntax, structure, and element/attribute rules. Aiming for <em>valid</em> HTML (not just well-formed) is a key aspect of professional web development.</p>
