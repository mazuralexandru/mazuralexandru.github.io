  <h1>Quotation Elements</h1>
  <p>The blockquote element is used for long quotations:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>This is a longer quotation, potentially spanning multiple paragraphs, taken from another source. It indicates that this content is not the original author's own words.</p>
    <p>Blockquotes are typically indented by browsers by default.</p>
  </blockquote> <!-- Added blockquote -->

  <p>This paragraph follows the blockquote.</p>


  <!-- <p>This paragraph is temporarily commented out.</p> -->
