  <h1>600. Graphics: Canvas (<code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;</code>) - Accessibility Considerations</h1>
<p><strong>Accessibility is a major challenge for <code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> content.</strong> Because the canvas itself is just a bitmap surface opaque to assistive technologies, significant effort is required to make canvas-based experiences accessible.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Screen Readers:</strong> Cannot &quot;see&quot; or interpret the pixels drawn on the canvas. They don&#39;t know what shapes, text, or data are represented visually unless alternative information is provided. The canvas element itself might just be announced as &quot;Canvas&quot; or based on its ARIA label.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Native browser focus and tab navigation do not work for elements <em>drawn</em> on the canvas. Users cannot interact with buttons, sliders, or data points within the canvas using only a keyboard by default.</li>
<li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> Text drawn using <code>ctx.fillText()</code> is rendered as pixels and is not treated as real text by browsers or assistive technology (it cannot be selected, copied, or easily read by screen readers).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mitigation Strategies (Essential):</strong></p>
<p>Making canvas accessible often involves building parallel or alternative interfaces:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fallback Content [Basic]:</strong> Provide meaningful content between the <code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;...&lt;/canvas&gt;</code> tags. This is crucial for non-supporting browsers and can offer a basic alternative (e.g., a static image of the chart, a link to a data table) for users whose assistive tech cannot interpret the canvas.</li>
<li><strong>ARIA Attributes on <code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;</code>:</strong> Add <code>role</code> (e.g., <code>role=&quot;img&quot;</code>, <code>role=&quot;application&quot;</code>) and <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code> to the <code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> element itself to give assistive technologies a general description of its purpose.<pre class="language-html"><code class="language-html">&lt;canvas id=&quot;chart&quot; aria-label=&quot;Bar chart showing monthly sales&quot;&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Shadow DOM / Parallel Accessible DOM:</strong> Maintain a separate, accessible HTML structure (often visually hidden using CSS) that mirrors the <em>information</em> and <em>interactive elements</em> presented on the canvas. Screen readers interact with this hidden DOM, while visual users see the canvas. JavaScript keeps the hidden DOM and the canvas visuals synchronized. This is complex but often necessary for interactive charts or applications.</li>
<li><strong>Keyboard Support via JavaScript:</strong> Implement keyboard event listeners (<code>keydown</code>) on the canvas element (or its container) to manually manage focus, navigate between interactive drawn elements, and trigger actions using keys like <code>Enter</code>, <code>Space</code>, and arrow keys. Provide visible focus indicators drawn onto the canvas.</li>
<li><strong>Text Alternatives:</strong> If displaying significant text or data, ensure that information is also available in an accessible format outside the canvas (e.g., in accompanying text, a linked data table, or the fallback content).</li>
<li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Ensure sufficient contrast between colors used in the canvas drawing for users with low vision or color blindness.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Creating truly accessible canvas experiences requires significant, deliberate effort beyond just drawing the visuals. It often involves building alternative representations or using advanced techniques like parallel DOM structures and manual keyboard handling. <strong>If accessibility is a primary concern and the graphic is suitable, SVG is often the more accessible choice due to its inherent DOM structure.</strong></p>
<p>✅ <strong>Observation:</strong> No code changes. Review the fallback content inside the <code class="language-html">&lt;canvas&gt;</code> tag in <code>index.html</code> (lesson 591). Recognize that this fallback is the <em>only</em> natively accessible part for screen readers if no further ARIA or JS techniques are employed. Understand the significant extra work needed to make interactive canvas content accessible.</p>
<p>✨ <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> Canvas content is inherently inaccessible. Providing accessibility requires significant effort, including robust fallback content, ARIA attributes on the canvas element, and often parallel DOM structures and custom keyboard handling implemented via JavaScript. SVG is generally more accessible out-of-the-box for structured graphics.</p>
