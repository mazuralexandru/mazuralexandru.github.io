  <h1>Quotation Elements</h1>
  <p>The blockquote element is used for long quotations. For shorter, inline quotes, use the q element, like this: He said, <q>That's fascinating!</q> right in the middle of the sentence.</p> <!-- Added <q> example -->

  <blockquote cite="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/textlevel-semantics.html#the-blockquote-element">
    <p>This is a longer quotation, potentially spanning multiple paragraphs, taken from another source. It indicates that this content is not the original author's own words.</p>
    <p>Blockquotes are typically indented by browsers by default.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>This paragraph follows the blockquote.</p>


  <!-- <p>This paragraph is temporarily commented out.</p> -->
